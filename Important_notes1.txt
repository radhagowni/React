# It is not mandatory to start a component with pascal case but good practice.
# while importing it should be function name but from file [import Greet(func name) from './components/Hello[file name].jsx]
# It's better to use .jsx extension because it works well for the component which consists of JavaScript&html code.
# If the file consists of only JavaScript then go with .js.
