🗂️ FOLDERS:
1.node-modules
2.public
3.src 

1.node_modules:

* Contains all the libraries and dependencies your project needs(Reactitself,Vite,etc)
* You don't edit this folder directly -it's managed automatically when you run {npm install}.

2.public :

* Stores static files like images,icons,or index.html.
* Anything inside public is served as it is(without processing by React).
* Example :favicon ,logo,manifest files.

3.src :

* This is where you write your actual React code.
* Contains components,styles,and app logic.
* By default you see App.jsx/App.js,main.jsx/main.js and sometimes App.css.

 💫💫 Do you ever thought "WHY DO WE WORK WITH ONLY src FOLDER ? WHY NOT WITH OTHER FOLDERS? 
  
Because -
1)Separation of concerns
  * src = all your source code(React components,logic,styles)
  * Other folders like public and node_modules are not meant to be changed frequently.

2)Build process 
  * When you run npm run build, tools like Vite/Webpack only look inside src to bundle your React app.
  * Files in src go through processing (jsx -> js ,css modules,optimizations)
  * Other folders are copied as they are.

3)Maintainability
  *Keeping all app logic in one place(src) makes the project organized and scalable.
  *Imagine if code was scattered between public and root files ,it would become messy.

4)Hot Reloading
 *The dev server(Vite) watches the src folder for changes.
 *Whenever you update a file inside src,it automatically refreshes the app.
 *If you change outside src(like in public) ,you need a full reload.

5)Best practice/convention
 * By convention,React developers put all components,pages,hooks,services in src.
 * public is only static files and node_modules is auto-generated,so you don't touch it.
  

# If you put JS/JSX in public,Vite/Webpack won't compile it,React features won't work.
# If you modify node_modules,changes will be lost when reinstalling dependencies.
# Root files like vite.config.js are project level settings ,not where app logic belongs.


👉 Inshort:
 
We use src because it's the only folder compiled,optimised,and watched by React's bundler.
Other folders are supporting roles.
