i)package.json 
  â€¢ The heart of the project.
  â€¢ Lists project metadata,dependencies,scripts(npm  run dev ,npm run build,etc)
  â€¢ Why we need it?
    > projects details -- name,versions,description
    > Dependencies -- lists all libraries needed
    > Scripts -- shortcuts to run tasks(like npm run dev)
    > Compatability--ensures your project can be installed and run anywhere with same setup.

ii)package-lock.json
  â€¢ Keeps exact versions of dependencies(so your project works the same everywhere).
  â€¢ Auto generated when you run npm install.
  â€¢ Why we need it?
    â€¢Ensures the app runs the same on every machine.(avoids "works on my computer)
    â€¢helps npm install packages faster,since it already knows the dependency tree.

iii).gitignore
  â€¢ Tells git which files/folders to ignore (like node_modules).

iv)vite.config.js
  â€¢ Configuration file for the bundler(Vite or webpack)
  â€¢ Controls how your project is built,optimised ,etc.

v)index.html
  â€¢ Inside the public folder.
  â€¢ The single HTML page that react injects into.
  â€¢ It contains a root<div id='root'></div>
  â€¢ Why we need it? -- without this file,there is no base webpage for React to render onto.

vi)main.jsx
  â€¢ Entry point for react.
  â€¢ It connects your App component to the index.html root div.

vii)App.jsx
  â€¢ The first component of your react app.
  â€¢ Think of it as the homepage of the project.

viii)App.css
  â€¢ Styles for the default App component.

ix)eslint.config.js
  â€¢ This file is for ESLint,a tool that checks your code for errors,bugs,or style issues.
  â€¢ We need it because it keeps code clean and consistent(avoids unused variables,missing semicolons.)
  â€¢ Catches potential bugs early(using a variables before declaring it).
  â€¢ Ensures your project follows best practices and coding standards.

x)REAdME.md
  â€¢ A markdown file(text+formatting) that describes your project.
  â€¢ Why we need it?
     â€¢ Acts like a user guide -> explains what the project is, how to install and run it. 
     â€¢ Useful when sharing your project on Github or with recruiters.
